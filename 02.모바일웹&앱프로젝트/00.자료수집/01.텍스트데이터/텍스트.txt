TEAMAKER'SGUESTHOUSE

작은내용
Our entry to the Teamakers Guest House competition received
an honourable mention in this open international competition.


A considered approach has been taken to design a building that
sits comfortably in the current context. Careful attention has
been paid to the material choices to reflect the function of the
building while being aesthetically distinct and proudly represent
the Lauku Tea brand and your continued narrative.


We have thoughtfully composed a building that opens up to
nature so that guests can experience more of their surroundings
while they work.

하프내용
The spaces allows for two intertwining journeys to occur as the tea maker meanders from the outdoors to the 
indoors, from production to accommodation. Central to 
our design is the drying chimney. Used as a highly 
controlled drying space, this drying chimney is 
constructed from recycled stone with an added pink dye
 to create a warm to touch, terrazzo style chimney space
 reminiscent to the speckled patterns of tea leaves

색배경
Our design is a distillation of the process
of herbal tea production, the Latvian wilderness, 
and traditional rural Latvian building typologies
where the hearth was the focal point of shelters.

작은내용
The N1C centre is the new home for the Somalian Youth
Development Resource Centre (SYDRC) and the Dragon Hall
Trust who are both charities providing education and activities at
and from the new community building.

하프내용
The centre piece of the project was a seating and 
reception desk fit out designed to be oiled and assembled 
purely by volunteers at the centre, which significantly 
reduced construction costs and also embedded the 
construction process into their own ethos of being for the 
community and delivered by the community.

Initially billed as a project on a tight budget, we set out 
designing a scheme which centred around their charity 
ethos – the community. Through employing the use of 
their volunteers we designed a scheme that was 
numbered and easy to construct removing the need for a 
professional fit out company. This not only embedded a 
sense of story in the space, it also reduced their initial 
budget figures by 78%.

작은내용
Set in St Dionis Road, Parsons Green the brief was to completely
renovate the existing Victorian terrace property to create a family
home whilst providing numerous extensions to the rear, loft, and
basement of the property.


Our designs included a completely open plan living space at the
ground floor fitted with multiple roof lights and crittall windows
opening out to the garden. Upstairs various additions allow for
additional bedroom spaces and bathrooms with wider views
looking out to the rear of the property.

This private 4 storey house in Singapore is built with a pigmented

change colour as you escalate up the building.

Externally, the building alternately shifts the facade plain 
in order to articulate the facade as well as creating all-
important shading for the bedrooms and living spaces.

The building is powered through rooftop solar panels and 
layouts are orientated to ensure both cross and stack 
ventilation throughout the house to minimize the need for 
mechanical ventilation.

MANOR ROAD
작은내용
Based in Reigate, Surrey this project for a private client involved a
contemporary rear extension and extensive internal renovations.


Initially, the brief was to create a traditional extension with
pitched tiled roofs and bi-fold doors with wide frames and
hinges, but after several design workshops, we were able to
develop a proposal that gave them a balcony space instead of a
pitched roof which doubled their area and gave them the prime
views across the garden to enjoy their tea from.
하프내용
Downstairs, the idea of bi-fold doors soon disappeared 
and was replaced with a fully glazed sliding door system 
with an opening corner. Careful detailing and a precise 
eye on specifications ensured that a glazed system with 
only 18mm frames allowed maximum amounts of daylight 
to flood the interiors.

The result is a glass and aluminium-clad extension with an 
opening corner that blends the interior into the exterior
 giving them space to truly enjoy their garden. Our project 
 has been widely published across multiple publications 
 including Real Homes and Build it magazine.

THE MEADOWS
작은내용
The brief called for increasing the amount of natural daylight
across the house and reconfiguring the layout in order to create a
functional and beautiful set of spaces. In turn, the house was
gutted, opened out to create open plan living, and open rooms
flooded with natural daylight.
하프내용
Our specifications included a material palette of timbers 
and silestone is consistently spread across the house, with 
differing treatment to the silestone depending on it’s 
application.

Typically across the kitchen and bathroom spaces we 
utilised a full gloss finish, whilst at the stair detail we were 
able to grit the stair with a sand blast finish to ensure we 
had enough slip resistance.

This helped to both lighten the spaces and make each 
room feel part of the same family.

A loved family home in Hounslow has been designed to maximize
the light, space, and openness. Impressive living space is
proposed with full height glazing that wraps into the ceiling and a
double-height atrium in the centre of the space.
하프내용
The existing building with a number of small spaces 
internally and cluttered facade has been given a go-ahead 
to a double-height rear extension with an internal 
reconfiguration of the main house and a three-level side 
extension.
The feature glazed rear extension has been designed to 
maximize the height, light, and openness of the living 
space with an amazing double-height heart/atrium, 
connecting the building with the rest of the house. 
The loved family home design approach was to create spaces 
of openness and generosity, giving a nod to the beautiful home.
The additional side extension is designed to be self-sufficient and independent from the main house. This is to offer privacy and independence to visitors, as well as infilling the unused drive and creating a private and secure rear garden.
