TEAMAKER'S GUESTHOUSE

작은내용
Our entry to the Teamakers Guest House competition received<br>an honourable mention in this open international competition.<br><br>A considered approach has been taken to design a building that<br>sits comfortably in the current context. Careful attention has<br>been paid to the material choices to reflect the function of the<br>building while being aesthetically distinct and proudly represent<br>the Lauku Tea brand and your continued narrative.<br><br><br>We have thoughtfully composed a building that opens up to<br>nature so that guests can experience more of their surroundings<br>while they work.<br>

하프내용
The spaces allows for two intertwining journeys to occur as the tea maker<br> meanders from the outdoors to the<br>indoors, from production to accommodation. Central to<br>our design is the drying chimney. Used as a highly<br>controlled drying space, this drying chimney is<br>constructed from recycled stone with an added pink dye<br>to create a warm to touch, terrazzo style chimney space<br>reminiscent to the speckled patterns of tea leaves<br>

색배경
Our design is a distillation of the process<br>of herbal tea production, the Latvian wilderness,<br>and traditional rural Latvian building typologies<br>where the hearth was the focal point of shelters.

The centre piece of the project was a seating and<br>reception desk fit out designed to be oiled and assembled<br>purely by volunteers at the centre, which significantly<br>reduced construction costs and also embedded the<br> construction process into their own ethos of being for the<br>community and delivered by the community.<br><br>Initially billed as a project on a tight budget, we set out<br>designing a scheme which centred around their charity<br> ethos – the community. Through employing the use of<br>their volunteers we designed a scheme that was<br>numbered and easy to construct removing the need for a<br>professional fit out company. This not only embedded a<br>sense of story in the space, it also reduced their initial<br>budget figures by 78%.

작은내용
Based in Reigate, Surrey this project for a private client involved a<br>contemporary rear extension and extensive internal renovations.<br><br><br>Initially, the brief was to create a traditional extension with<br>pitched tiled roofs and bi-fold doors with wide frames and<br>hinges, but after several design workshops, we were able to<br>develop a proposal that gave them a balcony space instead of a<br>pitched roof which doubled their area and gave them the prime<br>views across the garden to enjoy their tea from.
하프내용
Downstairs, the idea of bi-fold doors soon disappeared<br>and was replaced with a fully glazed sliding door system<br>with an opening corner. Careful detailing and a precise<br>eye on specifications ensured that a glazed system with<br> only 18mm frames allowed maximum amounts of daylight<br>to flood the interiors.<br><br>The result is a glass and aluminium-clad extension with an<br>opening corner that blends the interior into the exterior<br>giving them space to truly enjoy their garden. Our project<br>has been widely published across multiple publications<br>including Real Homes and Build it magazine.

The brief called for increasing the amount of natural daylight<br>across the house and reconfiguring the layout in order to create a<br>functional and beautiful set of spaces. In turn, the house was<br>gutted, opened out to create open plan living, and open rooms<br>flooded with natural daylight.
