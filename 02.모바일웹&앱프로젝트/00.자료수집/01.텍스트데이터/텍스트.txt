TEAMAKER'SGUESTHOUSE

작은내용
Our entry to the Teamakers Guest House competition received
an honourable mention in this open international competition.


A considered approach has been taken to design a building that
sits comfortably in the current context. Careful attention has
been paid to the material choices to reflect the function of the
building while being aesthetically distinct and proudly represent
the Lauku Tea brand and your continued narrative.


We have thoughtfully composed a building that opens up to
nature so that guests can experience more of their surroundings
while they work.

하프내용
The spaces allows for two intertwining journeys to occur as the tea maker meanders from the outdoors to the 
indoors, from production to accommodation. Central to 
our design is the drying chimney. Used as a highly 
controlled drying space, this drying chimney is 
constructed from recycled stone with an added pink dye
 to create a warm to touch, terrazzo style chimney space
 reminiscent to the speckled patterns of tea leaves

색배경
Our design is a distillation of the process
of herbal tea production, the Latvian wilderness, 
and traditional rural Latvian building typologies
where the hearth was the focal point of shelters.

N1C

작은내용
The N1C centre is the new home for the Somalian Youth
Development Resource Centre (SYDRC) and the Dragon Hall
Trust who are both charities providing education and activities at
and from the new community building.

하프내용
The centre piece of the project was a seating and 
reception desk fit out designed to be oiled and assembled 
purely by volunteers at the centre, which significantly 
reduced construction costs and also embedded the 
construction process into their own ethos of being for the 
community and delivered by the community.

Initially billed as a project on a tight budget, we set out 
designing a scheme which centred around their charity 
ethos – the community. Through employing the use of 
their volunteers we designed a scheme that was 
numbered and easy to construct removing the need for a 
professional fit out company. This not only embedded a 
sense of story in the space, it also reduced their initial 
budget figures by 78%.

ST DIONIS
ROAD

작은내용
Set in St Dionis Road, Parsons Green the brief was to completely
renovate the existing Victorian terrace property to create a family
home whilst providing numerous extensions to the rear, loft, and
basement of the property.


Our designs included a completely open plan living space at the
ground floor fitted with multiple roof lights and crittall windows
opening out to the garden. Upstairs various additions allow for
additional bedroom spaces and bathrooms with wider views
looking out to the rear of the property.

CONCRETE
HOUSE
작은내용
This private 4 storey house in Singapore is built with a pigmented
concrete structure as it's primary structural system. Pigments
change colour as you escalate up the building.
하프내용
Externally, the building alternately shifts the facade plain 
in order to articulate the facade as well as creating all-
important shading for the bedrooms and living spaces.

The building is powered through rooftop solar panels and 
layouts are orientated to ensure both cross and stack 
ventilation throughout the house to minimize the need for 
mechanical ventilation.
